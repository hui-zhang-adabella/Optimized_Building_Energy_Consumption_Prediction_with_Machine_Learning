# 🏢 Optimized Building Energy Consumption Prediction with ML 📊

This work aimed to create an accurate energy consumption forecasting framework to promote sustainable building energy use. For accuracy, it evaluated various algorithms like ERT, RR, GBT, RF, ANN, and SVM and introduced an ensemble method and the HBO-Ensemble algorithm to improve predictions. Results showed RR, ERT, and GBoosting were the best individual algorithms, and the ensemble model improved results. The HBO-Ensemble algorithm outperformed all, enhancing prediction accuracy significantly. These findings have implications for energy management and efficiency strategies in buildings. Future research should expand datasets, consider more features, and explore other optimization techniques while also assessing generalizability across different regions and building types.
